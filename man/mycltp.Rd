\title{Simulate Sample Means from a Poisson Distribution}
\usage{
mycltp(n, iter, lambda = 4)
}
\arguments{
\item{n}{Integer. The sample size (number of observations in each iteration).}

\item{iter}{Integer. The number of iterations or samples to generate.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric. The rate parameter (λ) of the Poisson distribution. Defaults to 4.}
}
\value{
A histogram is produced in the active graphics device.
The function also (invisibly) returns a numeric vector of sample means for further analysis.
}
\description{
This function demonstrates the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) using random samples
from a Poisson distribution. It repeatedly generates samples, computes their
means, and displays a histogram of the sample means with an overlaid theoretical
normal curve for comparison.
}
\examples{
# Example: Generate 10,000 samples of size 5 from Poisson(4)
mycltp(n = 5, iter = 10000, lambda = 4)

# Larger sample size for smoother CLT behavior
mycltp(n = 20, iter = 10000, lambda = 10)
